# Humongous Entertainment Music Extractor

Humongous Entertainment (HE) Music Extractor is a tool to extract music from
HE games. Songs are stored in a monolithic data file with a `.HE4` file
extension.

**DISCLAIMER**: I do not support or endorse piracy. This tool was developed
using data from HE games I purchased myself [on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/sub/42723/)
and by reading source code of the GPL-licensed [ScummVM](https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm)
which these games run on.

You will need [Python](https://python.org) and a copy of [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
